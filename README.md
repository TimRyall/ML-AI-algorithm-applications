***
Applications of many ML and AI algorithms on real datasets. Each application includes examples and figures.
***

These programs utilize libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow (Keras), and other optimization & ML packages.

The main algorithms used involve:

* Neural networks including:
    - Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
    - Convolutional neural network (CNN)

* Ensemble methods including:
    - Bagging
    - Random Forests
    - Boosting
    - AdaBoost

* K-fold Cross-validation
* Regularization
* General data cleaning and processing
* K-nearest neighbors algorithm (k-NN)
* Decision Trees
* Linear regression
* Polynomial regression
