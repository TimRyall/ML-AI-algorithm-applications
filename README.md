Applications of many ML and AI algorithms on real datasets. Each application includes examples and figures.

These programs utilize libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow (Keras), and other optimization & ML packages.

The main algorithms used involve:

    Neural networks including:
        Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
        Convolutional neural network (CNN)

    Ensemble methods including:
        Bagging
        Random Forests
        Boosting
        AdaBoost

    K-fold Cross-validation
    Regularization
    General data cleaning and processing
    K-nearest neighbors algorithm (k-NN)
    Decision Trees
    Linear regression
    Polynomial regression
